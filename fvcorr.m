% fvcorr takes as input a data matrix and associated labels (in format -1 and 1)
% and calculates the cross correlation matrix.
% USAGE: fvcorr(data, labels)
% INPUT: 
%	 data: a n x M matrix with n subjects, m columns of features
%    labels: a n X 1 column of labels, -1 and 1
% OUTPUT: ccdata: cross correlation matrix
