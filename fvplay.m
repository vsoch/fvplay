function data = fvplay(fv,type)
% fvplay takes as input an fv data object prepared by fvprep, and
% allows the user to select a transform to plot (to explore the data)
% Returns the data, and uses fvplot to display plot in figures 1 and 2
%
% USAGE: fvplot(fvobject,type)
% INPUT: fv: the fv data object prepared by fvprep
%	 type: options include:
%			quad: quadratic transformation
%			sqrt: square root transform
%			exp: exponential transformation
%			sig: sigmoid transformation
%			log: logarithmic transformation
%			abs: absolute value transform
% OUTPUT: data: transformed n x m data matrix with n subjects (rows)
%		and m features (columns)
